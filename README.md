# House Price Prediction App

This project is a *Flutter-based House Price Prediction Application* that combines the power of *data science* with an intuitive *mobile-friendly frontend*. Users can input details about a property, and the app predicts its market price based on the trained machine learning model.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend**: Developed using Flutter for a sleek and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Built with Python, utilizing data science and machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions.

The app is designed for *real estate enthusiasts* and *buyers/sellers* to estimate property prices quickly and easily.

## Features

### üè† *Fields for Prediction*
Users can input property details via an intuitive interface:
- *Type of Building**: Dropdown menu for options like Apartment, Bungalow, Duplex, etc.*
- **Country**: Dropdown menu for selecting the country.
- **State**: Dropdown menu for the property‚Äôs state/region.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: Input for the number of bedrooms.
- **Number of Toilets and Bathrooms**: Input for the total number of restrooms.
- **Fully Furnished**: Yes/No option.
- **Newly Built**: Yes/No option.

### üîç *Prediction Results*
- A *screen displays the predicted price* after all details are submitted.
- Instant price calculation using the trained ML model.

## Technologies Used

### *Frontend*
- **Flutter**: For crafting the user interface.
- **Dart**: The programming language for Flutter.

### *Backend*
- **Python**: Used for developing the predictive backend.
- **Data Science Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn` for training the prediction model.
- **Flask**: For creating a REST API to connect the Python backend to the Flutter frontend.

## Setup Instructions

### üõ†Ô∏è *Backend Setup*
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the backend folder:
  
   
3. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Run the Flask server:

   python app.py
   

### üì± *Frontend Setup*
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   
2. Install Flutter dependencies:

   flutter pub get
   
3. Run the app:

   flutter run

## How the Prediction Works

1. The user fills in the form on the Flutter frontend.
2. The app sends the data to the Python backend using REST APIs.
3. The backend uses a trained ML model to process the inputs and return the predicted price.
4. The prediction result is displayed in the app.

## Future Improvements
- **Add more fields**: Additional property details like amenities, and age of the building.
- **Model improvement**: Incorporate more advanced ML algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Include charts and graphs for price trends and factor importance.
