# House Price Prediction App

This project is a *Flutter-based House Price Prediction Application* that combines the power of *data science* with a *mobile-friendly frontend*. Users can input details about a property, and the app predicts its market price based on the trained machine learning model.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend**: Developed using Flutter for a sleek and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Built with Python, utilizing data science and machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions.

The app is designed for *real estate enthusiasts* and *buyers/sellers* to estimate property prices quickly and easily in Nigeria.

</div>

- **Number of Bedrooms**: Input for the number of bedrooms.

- **Number of Toilets and Bathrooms**: Input for the total number of restrooms.
  
- **Fully Furnished**: Yes/No option.
  
- **Newly Built**: Yes/No option.



## Technologies Used

### *Frontend*
- **Flutter**: For crafting the user interface.
- **Dart**: The programming language for Flutter.

### *Backend*
- **Python**: Used for developing the predictive backend.
- **Data Science Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn` for training the prediction model.
- **Flask**: For creating a REST API to connect the Python backend to the Flutter frontend.

## How the Prediction Works

1. The user fills in the form on the Flutter frontend.
2. The app sends the data to the Python backend.
3. The backend uses a trained ML model to process the inputs and return the predicted price.
4. The prediction result is displayed in the app.

## Future Improvements
- **Add more fields**: Additional property details like amenities, and age of the building.
- **Model improvement**: Incorporate more advanced ML algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Include charts and graphs for price trends and factor importance.
